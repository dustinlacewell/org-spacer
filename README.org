#+TITLE: org-spacer.el

This simple package allows you to enforce the number of blanks lines after
elements in an org-mode document.

This package is *experimental* and might delete some contents of your buffer
other than blank lines if there are bugs. Contribution is very welcome.

* Installation
** el-get
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (el-get-bundle org-spacer
    :url "https://github.com/dustinlacewell/org-spacer.el.git"
    :features org-spacer)
#+end_src

** straight.el
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package org-spacer
    :straight (org-spacer :type git :host github :repo "dustinlacewell/org-spacer.el")
#+end_src

* Configuration
** org-spacer-element-blanks
This variable controls which org elements you want processed and how many blank
lines to enforce for each.

It is a list of lists. Each inner list's car is the number of blanks. One or
more org element symbols may follow:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-spacer-element-blanks
    '((0 headline)
      (1 paragraph src-block table property-drawer)))
#+end_src

* Usage
Just execute =M-x org-spacer-enforce= to apply spacings.

Alternatively, add it to a =before-save-hook=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook
            (lambda () (add-hook 'before-save-hook
                            'org-spacer-enforce nil 'make-it-local)))
#+end_src
